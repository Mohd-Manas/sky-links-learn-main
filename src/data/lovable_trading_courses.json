The aim is often to profit from price changes, but trading can also be used to protect investments from market risks. With the rise of online platforms, nearly anyone can participate in trading, accessing markets that once were open only to institutions.\n\nBefore jumping into how to trade, it’s important to understand:\n- What trading actually is (and what it isn’t)\n- The main types of markets you can trade in\n- The different styles of trading you might choose\n\nGetting these fundamentals right will give you a strong foundation for everything else in the course.\n\n### Trading vs. Investing\n\nAlthough people often mix up the terms, trading and investing are different approaches:\n\n|  | **Trading** | **Investing** |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Horizon** | Short to medium term (seconds to months) | Long term (years to decades) |\n| **Focus** | Price movements | Business/asset growth |\n| **Leverage** | Often uses leverage | Rarely uses leverage |\n| **Activity** | More frequent buying and selling | Fewer transactions |\n| **Risk/Return** | Higher potential returns and higher risk | Generally lower risk with steadier returns |\n\n**Example**  \n- **Trader:** Buys Apple stock in the morning, sells it the same day for a 2% gain.  \n- **Investor:** Buys Apple stock and holds it for 10 years, benefiting from growth and dividends.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Trading is about capturing short-term opportunities. Investing is about building wealth over time.\n\n### The Main Markets in Trading\n\nFinancial trading is the act of buying and selling assets with the aim of making a profit or meeting a specific need. Major markets include:\n- **Shares:** Units of ownership in a company (e.g., Microsoft, Netflix, HSBC).\n- **Stock indices:** Values tracking groups of companies (e.g., S&P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225).\n- **Forex:** Global market for currencies (euro, USD, JPY, etc.).\n- **Commodities:** Raw materials like gold, oil, wheat, coffee.\n- **Cryptocurrencies:** Digital assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple.\n\nPeople and organizations participate for speculation or necessity (e.g., a business buying JPY to pay a supplier).\n\n### How trades actually work (with Sky Links Capital as example)\n\n1. **Placing your order:** Choose an asset, decide to **buy (long)** or **sell (short)**, and enter order details.  \n2. **Order routing:** As an **STP broker**, Sky Links Capital routes orders to liquidity providers for best available price.  \n3. **Trade execution:** Market orders fill at current price; limit orders at a specified price.  \n4. **Market movement & exit:** Monitor and close to realize profit or loss.\n\n**Example:** You buy gold at $1,950/oz. Later, price rises to $1,970. Closing the position realizes a $20 gain per ounce (minus fees).\n\n### Key Market Concepts\n\n- **Bulls vs. Bears:** Bulls expect rising prices; bears expect declines.  \n- **Volatility:** Magnitude/speed of price moves—higher potential reward and risk.  \n- **Liquidity:** Ease of entering/exiting trades without moving price; higher liquidity = tighter spreads.\n"
